Now that we've created everything, now we can test to ensure there's nothing that needs fixed. Follow along to test:

2. Be sure to login to your account in the top right
3. Choose your web messenger deployment from the drop down, and then press Start Chat
4. Click on the web messenger icon that renders in the box

5. Upon clicking the icon and saying 'Hello', the dispute bot will kick into action and read off the transactions and then provide you the option on what store to dispute the transaction with
